## Project Overview

In banks, huge data records information about their customers. This data can be used to create and keep
clear relationship and connection with the customers in order to target them individually for definite products or
banking offers. Usually, the selected customers are contacted directly through: personal contact, telephone cellular,
mail, and email or any other contacts to advertise the new product/service or give an offer, this kind of marketing is
called direct marketing. In fact, direct marketing is in the main a strategy of many of the banks and insurance
companies for interacting with their customers [1].


Historically, the name and identification of the term direct marketing suggested first time in 1967 by Lester
Wunderman, which he is considered to be the father of direct marketing [2]. In addition, some of the banks and
financial-services companies may depend only on strategy of mass marketing for promoting a new service or product
to their customers. In this strategy, a single communication message is broadcasted to all customers through media
such as television, radio or advertising firm, etc. [3]. In this approach, companies do not set up a direct relationship to
their customers for new-product offers. In fact, many of the customers are not interesting or respond to this kind of
sales promotion [4].


Accordingly, banks, financial-services companies and other companies are shifting away from mass marketing
strategy because its ineffectiveness, and they are now targeting most of their customers by direct marketing for
specific product and service offers [1, 4]. Due to the positive results clearly measured; many marketers attractive to the
direct marketing. For example, if a marketer sends out 1,000 offers by mail and 100 respond to the promotion, the
marketer can say with confidence that the campaign led immediately to 10% direct responses. This metric is known as
the 'Response Rate', and it is one of many clear quantifiable success metrics employed by direct marketers.
From the literature, the direct marketing is becoming a very important application in data mining these days.


The data mining has been used widely in direct marketing to identify prospective customers for new products, by using
purchasing data, a predictive model to measure that a customer is going to respond to the promotion or an offer [5].
Data mining has gained popularity for illustrative and predictive applications in banking processes.
